# Objective 

Evaluate the effect of increasing the level gate from level 30 to 40 on Day 1 user retention in a mobile game. The test design follows a randomized controlled trial. A required sample size of 9,712 users per group, with a minimum detectable effect (MDE) of 2%, was determined and fulfilled according to power analysis.

# Sample sanity check 

Test if group assignment is balanced.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(ab_tbl$version))
```

The chi-squared test indicates a statistically significant imbalance between group sizes (p < 0.01). Although assignment was randomized, the observed difference may be due to sampling variability. 

# A/B test results 

Two-sample test for difference in retention proportions.

**Null hypothesis:** There is no significant difference in DAY 1 retention rate between gate 30 and gate 40.  

**Alternative hypothesis:** There is a statistically significant difference in retention rate between gate 30 and gate 40.

```{r}
AB_prop_test(ab_tbl, version, retention_1)
```

**P-value > 0.05**

Null hypothesis can not be rejected:

**There is no statistically significant difference in retention rate at the 5% level.**

# Logistic regression 

```{r}
reg_tbl <- ab_tbl %>% 
  mutate(retention_1 = factor(retention_1),
         version = factor(version))

reg_results <-  glm(retention_1 ~ version + gamerounds, reg_tbl, family = "binomial")

summary(reg_results)
```

**The odds of retention for gate_40 are ~3% lower compared to gate_30, controlling for number of rounds. Effect is statistical significant on the 5% level.**

# Conclusion

The two-proportion test did not detect a statistically significant difference in day 1 retention between the two groups (p = 0.0755). However, when adjusting for gameplay behavior using logistic regression, the treatment group (`gate_40`) showed a small but statistically significant decrease in retention odds compared to the control.

This suggests that retention differences are not visible at the aggregate level, but become evident when accounting for user engagement. While the absolute effect is modest (~3% lower odds), the result is consistent and statistically supported.

Given the imbalance in group sizes, and the borderline result in the unadjusted test, findings should be interpreted with some caution. Further validation is recommended using longer-term retention or downstream metrics.
